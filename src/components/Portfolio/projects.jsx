              I teamed up with a friend on a game for people to play during the
              2020 United States Democratic Primary Debates. While they watched,
              users could click on a candidate's balloon when they agreed with
              what they were saying.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the end, we have a quantified metric for how well each
              candidate resonated with players. It was really fun to create an
              in-browser game, and figuring out the best ways to sync the game
              with an external video.

              After Umbel moved into its new office in the old Power Plant, we
              wanted to make a great first impression with our entrance screens.
              I wanted to build an interface that keeps visitors and employees

            <p>
              There are many issues with how we receive our news (in the United

              In 2015, Umbel hosted an official SXSW party (with Spoon!). To
              incorporate our brand and liven up the VIP section, I build a
              virtual photobooth that superimposes a luchador mask on guests’
              faces.
            </p>
            <p>
              I built a C++ app that detects faces from a webcam feed in
              real-time and renders a mask over anything that looks like a face
              (based on some training data). The face is broken into sections,
              and the mask is stretched to fit the different parts of the face,
              which makes it pretty realistic, even when someone is talking. The
              user can use a foot pedal to either cycle through the faces or
              take a picture.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you look closely, you can see people’s concentration as they
              try to balance and take a picture. Additionally, I built a web app
              to show the photos in real-time and allow people to share on
              social media.

  //             From time to time, I find myself being more ambitious than I have

  //             woodworker, turned the bed design into a real, wooden table. Along
