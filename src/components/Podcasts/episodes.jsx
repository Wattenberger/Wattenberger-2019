    I reached out to David to tell him how much I was enjoying listening to his podcast, and he was kind enough to invite me on. We had a great chat about ways to make yourself stand out and finding a career that you find exciting.

    I'm a huge fan of the PolicyViz Podcast with <Link href="https://twitter.com/jschwabish">Jon Schwabish</Link> — he always has great guests, a relaxed vibe, and asks great questions.

    In this episode, we chat about <Link href="https://www.newline.co/fullstack-d3">Fullstack D3 and Data Visualization</Link>, developing data viz in the browser, and a really fun augmented reality project I worked on.

    Data Stories is one of my favorite podcasts — I love how much fun Enrico and Moritz seem to have when they record! I was delighted when they reached out for their end-of-year episode.
    <br />
    I got to talk about <b>learning data viz from a newcomer's perspective</b>, including the new <Link href="https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/connect">Data Visualization Society</Link>, <Link href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/736737028247625415/Datavizer">a plugin I created for Figma</Link>, and the challenge of being aware of data collection.
